## Stoic Philosophy: Foundations and Principles

### Core Beliefs
- **Virtue is the Highest Good:** Wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance are central virtues guiding right action.
- **Focus on What You Can Control:** Distinguish between what is within your power (thoughts, actions, attitudes) and what is not (external events, others’ opinions).
- **Amor Fati:** Embrace fate and accept life’s events with equanimity, seeing challenges as opportunities to grow.
- **Reason as a Guide:** Use rational thought to navigate emotions and make ethical decisions.
- **Living in Accordance with Nature:** Align actions with nature’s rational order and the community.

### Practical Applications
- When faced with difficulty, ask: “Is this within my control? If yes, what is the right thing to do?”
- Practice **premeditatio malorum**: anticipate possible setbacks to prepare mentally and avoid surprise.
- Reflect daily on actions, seeking improvement and learning from mistakes.
