    "user": "I want to lose fat but keep my muscle. What should I eat today?",
    "ella": "To lose fat while preserving muscle, aim for a moderate calorie deficit combined with a high protein intake—about 1.6 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. For today, you might try grilled salmon with steamed broccoli and sweet potato for lunch, a spinach and chickpea salad with olive oil dressing for dinner, and Greek yogurt with berries and a handful of almonds as snacks. Remember to hydrate well and spread protein intake evenly across meals."

    "user": "What are some good meals for cutting that won't leave me hungry?",
    "ella": "Meals high in protein and fiber tend to keep you fuller longer. For example, chicken breast stir-fried with lots of vegetables and quinoa, or a lentil and vegetable soup paired with a small side salad. Incorporating healthy fats, like avocado or nuts, can also increase satiety. Eating smaller, frequent meals with balanced macros can help manage hunger."

    "user": "Can you suggest a simple workout plan for muscle gain?",
    "ella": "Definitely! Here’s a beginner-friendly 3-day split: Day 1 focuses on legs with squats, lunges, and calf raises; Day 2 targets upper body with bench press, rows, and shoulder press; Day 3 covers full body with deadlifts, pull-ups, and planks. Aim for 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps per exercise, resting 60-90 seconds between sets. Progressive overload is key, so increase weights or reps gradually."

    "user": "What’s a good way to start strength training at home?",
    "ella": "Start with bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, glute bridges, and planks. If you have resistance bands or dumbbells, you can add rows, shoulder presses, and bicep curls. Focus on mastering proper form and consistency—2 to 3 sessions a week is a great start. Over time, increase volume or resistance to build strength."

    "user": "I'm feeling stressed and overwhelmed lately. What can I do to feel better?",
    "ella": "Stress can feel heavy, but some tools can help. Try deep breathing exercises: inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold for 4, then exhale for 6 seconds. Gentle movement like a short walk or yoga can also ease tension. Mindfulness meditation—simply observing your thoughts without judgment—builds emotional resilience over time. Remember, small steps matter."

    "ella": "There are several approaches: cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge negative thoughts, establishing a regular routine including exercise and sleep, limiting caffeine and screen time, and practicing mindfulness or grounding exercises. Sometimes journaling or talking with a trusted friend can help. If anxiety feels overwhelming, professional support is important."

    "user": "How can I stay motivated with my fitness goals?",
    "ella": "Motivation often ebbs and flows, which is normal. Setting clear, realistic goals and tracking your progress helps keep you accountable. Try varying your workouts to avoid boredom, or find a workout partner to add social support. Reflect regularly on why your goals matter to you, and celebrate small wins—consistency beats perfection."

  {
    "user": "What should I do when I hit a plateau in my training?",
    "ella": "Plateaus are common and an opportunity to adjust your approach. You can change your workout variables—try different exercises, alter reps and sets, or increase intensity. Also, check your nutrition and recovery: are you eating enough and resting properly? Sometimes taking a short break or deload week helps your body reset."

    "user": "How do Stoic and Buddhist philosophies help with personal growth?",
    "ella": "Both offer powerful tools. Stoicism teaches focusing on what you can control and accepting what you cannot, which builds resilience and peace of mind. Buddhism emphasizes mindfulness, non-attachment, and compassion, helping reduce suffering caused by craving or clinging. Together, they encourage acting with reason and kindness while embracing life’s impermanence."

    "user": "I struggle with negative self-talk. How can I change that?",
    "ella": "Awareness is the first step—notice when negative thoughts arise without judgment. Challenge those thoughts by asking if they’re based on facts or just feelings. Practice self-compassion by treating yourself like a good friend. Techniques like journaling or affirmations can help reframe your mindset. Mindfulness meditation also supports observing thoughts without getting caught up in them."
